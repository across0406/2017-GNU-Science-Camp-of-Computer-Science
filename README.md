# 2017-GNU-Science-Camp-of-Computer-Science

The contents deal with basis of deep learning for GNU Science Camp of Computer Science targeting high school students.
For preparation this contents, I referred to the books to the following:

- Deep learning from scratch(밑바닥부터 시작하는 딥러닝)<sup>[1]</sup>
- 인공지능, 머신러닝, 딥러닝 입문<sup>[2]</sup>
- Python 3 Bible(파이썬 3 바이블)<sup>[3]</sup>
- Coding The Matrix(코딩 더 매트릭스)<sup>[4]</sup>

**1. Basis of Python 3.x**

This part includes basis of Python 3.x, such as output, for statement, if statement, and defining function, etc.

**2. Matrix coding and library**

As we use Numpy array to implement basic neural network, this section deals with using Numpy library, such as 
operations, drawing graph, etc. So, first, we inform basic theory to students. And then, the students follow the codes 
for this theory.

**3. Perceptron**

Most of codes are from "Deep learning from scratch". "Deep learning from scratch" started the contents of perceptron 
initially for the solution of logical gate. Then, enter into constructing three-layer perceptron. Finally, operate 
simple neural network for recognition MNIST dataset.
